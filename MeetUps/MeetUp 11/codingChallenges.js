Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in biological systems. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T').
Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U').
Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.
For example:
"GCAT"  =>  "GCAU"

Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.
By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.
E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.
If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.
