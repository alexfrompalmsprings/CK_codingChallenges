// Fizz Buzz is a classic interview question that apparently many engineering candidates can't solve! Let's cover it today.

// We're given a number in the form of an integer n.

// Write a function that returns the string representation of all numbers from 1 to n based on the following rules:

// If it's a multiple of 3, represent it as "fizz".

// If it's a multiple of 5, represent it as "buzz".

// If it's a multiple of both 3 and 5, represent it as "fizzbuzz".

// If it's neither, just return the number itself.




function fizzBuzz(n) {

}

console.log(fizzBuzz(5))
console.log(fizzBuzz(3))
console.log(fizzBuzz(7))
